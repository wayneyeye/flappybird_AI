in order to improve the performance
I did the following modifications to the original code
found at https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird

* limit the bird color to red
* limit the background to background-day.png
* limit the pipe color to green
* remove all the sound effects
* show the score at the bottom to minimize its impact
* base does not shift anymore
* K_a to enter AI mode while K_UP or K_SPACE to enter Manual mode
